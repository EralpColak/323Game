# Digital Citizenship Project - README

## Project Overview

This project, created as part of the 323 Digital Citizenship course, aims to enhance digital literacy among METU Junior students, focusing on the critical aspects of privacy and security. Our project includes three main components:

1. **Lecture Material**: Comprehensive content covering privacy and security in digital environments.
2. **Articulate Material**: Summarized interactive content designed to reinforce learning before assessments.
3. **Game**: An engaging, interactive game to help students recall and apply what they have learned.

## Game Design

The centerpiece of our project is an interactive game developed using Articulate 360. The game is designed to make learning about digital citizenship enjoyable and effective. Here are the key features and design considerations of the game:

### Key Features

- **Interactive Scenarios**: The game includes various scenarios that simulate real-life digital privacy and security challenges, allowing students to apply their knowledge in a safe environment.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Consistent with Gagne's principles, the game provides immediate feedback to help students understand their mistakes and learn correct practices.
- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: The game adjusts its difficulty based on the student's performance, ensuring a personalized learning experience.
- **Visual and Audio Elements**: High-quality graphics and audio are used to create an immersive learning experience. Animations and sound effects are tailored to maintain engagement and motivation.

### Design Process

1. **Storyboard Development**: The game was meticulously planned with detailed storyboards that outlined every interactive element and flow of the instruction. This helped in visualizing the user experience and ensuring consistency in design.
2. **Prototype and Testing**: Initial prototypes were tested with target users and experts. Feedback was collected to refine the game, focusing on usability and engagement.
3. **Final Adjustments**: Based on the feedback, final adjustments were made to the game's interface, buttons, and animations to enhance clarity and usability.

### Usability Considerations

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear markers and easy navigation to ensure that even students unfamiliar with Articulate can use it effectively.
- **Accessibility**: Efforts were made to ensure that the game can be accessed on various devices, though it performs best on a computer. A guide is included to help students who may face difficulties.
- **Motivation and Engagement**: The game includes motivational elements such as rewards and progress tracking to keep students engaged and encourage repeated playthroughs.

### Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: The game is hosted online and integrated with Moodle, making it easily accessible for all students.
- **Hardware**: A computer with an internet connection is required to play the game. Some animations may display at a lower resolution on less powerful devices, but this does not affect the overall functionality.
